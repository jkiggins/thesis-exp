* SNN Models
The norse SNN simulation framework comes with a few varients of spiking neurons
1. Generic LIF
2. Coba LIF
3. Izhikevich
4. Leaky Integrator
5. Adex LIF
6. Correlation LIF
7. Refractory LIF
8. Exponential LIF
9. Multi-Compartment LIF
10. LIF with threshold adaptation

** Generic LIF
The generic LIF is Governed by the following equations

\[
\frac{di}{dt} = -\Tau_{syn} * i(t) \\
i(t + 1) = \frac{di}{dt} * \Delta t + z(t) \\
\frac{d_{vm}}{dt} = -\Tau_{mem} * (v_{leak} - v_m(t)) + \frac{i(t)}{dt} \\
v(t + 1) = \frac{d_{vm}}{dt} * \Delta t
\]

The equation for $v_m$ is overridden in the case of a spike, and the membrane
voltage is instead set to $v_{reset}$. This model is best thought of as a RC
circuit. Input voltage spikes are applied to a conductance (weight), which
results in some current flowing into a 1F capacitor (the membrane voltage). This
explains the mixed use of voltage and current, as well as $dv$ increasing with
input current.
