* Overview
This report summarizes the behavior and control of two different astrocyte
models. These models were designed with activity modulation in mind, where the
astrocyte receives an input, which is integrated over time. This temporal
integration results in an output or "effect" which is meant to be beneficial to
the overall system. 

* Models
** Target Average Firing Rate
This model consists a state update function and parameters, along with an effect
function and parameters. The driving equations evaluated at each time step with
length dt.

Astrocyte State Update
$s = s + z * \alpha_s - s * \tau * dt$

Astrocyte Effect Computation
$eff = \alpha_e * (target - s)$

In this case the Astrocyte acts as a proportional controller, providing feedback
at the post-synaptic (pre-lif) connection. The magnitude of the effect, is
proportional to the difference between a target, and the astrocyte state
value. The overall goal of this behavior is to regulate high levels of neuron
activity and suppress periodic activity beyond the target rate. Whether this has
a computational benefit it remains to be seen.

** Average Rate Suppression
In this model the astrocyte uses two exponentially weighted averages of the
post-synaptic firing rate as the state. During the effect computation, an
additional multiplier is applied (must be negative for suppression) to the
difference between the two averages ($\alpha_1$ - $\alpha2$). applied as the
effect. 

Astrocyte State Update
$s_n = s_n * (1.0 - \alpha_n) + z * \alpha_n$

Astrocyte Effect Computation
$eff = \alpha * (s_1 - s_2)$

The goal in this case is to implement synapse-level habituation based on the
activity in a population of synapses. Such a control element might be able to
tune a population of synapse, or neurons to maximize contrast while ignoring
periodic noisy input.


* Topology
A few topologies are used across the two models

* Simulations
** Target Average Firing Rate
There are a few basic properties of this model that are intuitive, and supported
by simulation.

*** State Sensitivity
$\alpha_s$ can be thought of as the state sensitivity, since it controls how
much an input spike (or potential) contributes to the state in that time
step. In general, a lower sensitivity will reduce the Astrocyte's ability to
respond to activity, allowing more of the pre-synaptic information through.

This plot was generated by sweeping the alpha parameter with 10 evenly spaced
intervals from 0.1 to 1.5. For these simulations runs the following values were
used.
- activity alpha: 1.0
- activity target: 0.0
- tau: 80
- dt: 0.001

As expected, lower values in alpha result in a wider range of post-synaptic
activity since the astrocyte is unable to suppress it.

*** State Decay
As the astrocyte state decay parameter ($\Tau_s$) increases, the state will
decay more quickly, giving transient bursts an opportunity to effect the
membrane potential. This should lead to a higher total spike volume, as $\Tau_s$
increases.

[[./artifacts/astro_adapt_post_target_tau.png]]

Though the increase is slight, there is a larger spike volume, and increased
range in the post-synaptic rate, as $\Tau$ increases.

Below this effect is shown more clearly, see the 'Postsynaptic Moving Average'
plot.

*** Multiple Synapses
Continuing to use Topology A (TODO: check this), consider what would happen with
an astrocyte connected to two synapses (and the output of course) of a single
Generic LIF neuron. In general, output spikes would tend to be driven by input
spikes that are sparse in time, with the closest neightboring spike (in time)
being fairly far away. In this situation the Astrocyte effect would be more or
less decayed (depending on params). This behavior would also provide a general
suppression to sequential spikes, if these spikes were to arrive in a sort-of
packet.


Consider two synapses with different firing rates, one of 0.2 and one of 0.4,
the following behavior is observed.

[[./artifacts/astro_adapt_post_target_multi_alpha000.100_tau080.000_tar000.000_0000.png]]

In general the behavior is the same, with the output firing rate and moving
average showing an averaging of the inputs.

Consider now, the effect on temporally coded inputs. In the following
experiment, randomly generated "spike packets" are sent to a single Generic LIF
neuron with Astrocyte feedback. This is still using Topology A, except there are
10 inputs, with each serving as an output for the Astrocyte.

Below is the behavior where $\alpha_s = 0$ which is equivalent to the absence of
an astrocyte.

[[./artifacts/astro_adapt_post_target_multi_v2_alpha000.000_tau080.000_tar000.000_0000.png]]

The spike packet tends to cause a burst of output activity lasting for the
duration of the packet. Now consider the same simulation, but with non-zero
$\alpha$.

[[./artifacts/astro_adapt_post_target_multi_v2_alpha000.167_tau080.000_tar000.000_0001.png]]
[[./artifacts/astro_adapt_post_target_multi_v2_alpha000.256_tau080.000_tar000.000_0001.png]]

The astrocyte is able to achieve two very important things. First, the feedback
mechanism reduces output spike density to a more reasonable level, and avoids
burst firing across the entire duration of the "packet". This effect preserves
some of the timing information from input to output. Secondly, the astrocyte
behavior allows for different behavior depending on incoming spike order, and
latency between spikes.

This behavior is dependent on the shape of the "spike packet"

[[./artifacts/astro_adapt_post_target_multi_v2.png]]

The most output spike occur when the input spikes are highly clustered. In this
case the Astrocyte doesn't have sufficient time steps to "push back" against the
input activity, especially given its intensity. As the time-range of the spike
packet increases the output spiking volume decreases, likely due to the general
tendency of the input bursting activity to result in a similar bursting
output. Right around a timesteps of 80 the system exhibits an increase in output
spiking volume. This effect is a result of the gaps between spikes being wide
enough that the Astrocyte state has time to decay, and effect diminish.
